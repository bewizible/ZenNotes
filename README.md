# ZenNotes 📝✨

**ZenNotes is not your average note-taking app. It's the cool, laid-back cousin of note apps, WHY?**

- It's not just free; it's a 'free as a bird 🦅 & free as the wind 💨' kind of free! 🐦🌈
- Your notes are your fortress, and we're the moat around it. 🏰

**Syncing? Chillax Bruh, We Got This! 😎**

- Yep, we sync, and we do it with style! 🚀
- **HOW???**
- We just use your GitHub repo, bro. 🤝
- _Picture this:_ Use snazzy apps like Obsidian on your PC, push to GitHub, and groove to your notes on your phone. 🎶📱

**Total Control, Dude! 🕶️**

- We only need your GitHub account and a PAT (Personal Access Token) for your repo. 🕵️
- No funny business with your GitHub stuff. After all, we don't wanna mess with your Github Mojo, man! 🕶️🤘

**Freedom and Vibes, Baby! 🙌**

- ZenNotes: Where your notes are YOURS, no strings attached. 📚🔓
- Forget vendor lock-ins, forget snooping, just remember good vibes and open-source freedom. 🌟🚀

**ZenNotes: Because Your Notes Deserve to Be Free and Fabulous! 🌈🎉**
